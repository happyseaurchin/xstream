# Phase 0.7: Management & Tidy

**Scope Definition** (to be expanded after Phase 0.6)

---

## Purpose

Phase 0.7 addresses the management, visibility, and polish items that emerged during Phase 0.5 development but aren't required for multi-user foundation.

---

## Candidate Items

### Skill Visibility

- Skill influence indicators on entries

### Package Management
- Browse available packages
- Enable/disable packages for frame
- View package contents

### Frame Management
- Create new frames
- Configure frame settings
- Manage frame-level packages

### Platform/Frame Content
- Database tables for characters (beyond user shelf)
- Database tables for world elements (beyond user shelf)
- Platform and frame-level defaults

### UX Polish
- Loading states
- Error handling improvements
- Mobile responsiveness
- Keyboard shortcuts

### Authentication

## Dependencies

Phase 0.7 depends on Phase 0.6 completion because:
- Multi-user context affects what management means
- Shared frames need clear ownership/permission model
- User identity required for proper auth

---

## Not in Phase 0.7

- Hard-LLM coordination (Phase 1+)
- Proximity transitions (Phase 1+)
- NOMAD resolution system (Phase 1+)
- Opening codes and joining (Phase 1+)
